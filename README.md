## 📂 Recommendations

This analysis reveals two major user behavior patterns on Netflix:

- Users tend to prefer movies over TV shows. This is likely influenced by the growing popularity of short-form content on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels, which has contributed to decreasing attention spans and a preference for faster content consumption.

- Mystery-related genres — including sci-fi, fantasy, and thrillers — showed significantly higher engagement rates. These genres appear to perform well because they evoke strong emotions, curiosity, and excitement, which help capture and retain viewer attention.

Business Recommendation
- Based on these insights, it is recommended that Netflix invest more in mystery-themed content, particularly in movie formats rather than long TV series. This strategy would align with evolving user preferences for quicker, emotionally engaging content.
  
- Additionally, Netflix could explore producing short-form movies or limited mini-movie series (e.g., 60-80 minutes) to better appeal to audiences seeking faster-paced storytelling without compromising on emotional impact.
